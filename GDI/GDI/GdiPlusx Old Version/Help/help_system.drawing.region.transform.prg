** The following code example demonstrates the use of Region.Transform Method
** Creates a rectangle and draws it to the screen in blue. 
** Creates a region from the rectangle. 
** Creates a transform matrix and sets it to 45 degrees. 
** Apply the transform to the region. 
** Fill the transformed region with red and draw the transformed region to the screen in red.
