Windows GDI

	* Purpose
	The Microsoft Windows graphics device interface (GDI) enables applications to use graphics and formatted text on both the video display and the printer. Windows-based applications do not access the graphics hardware directly. Instead, GDI interacts with device drivers on behalf of applications.

	* Where applicable
	GDI can be used in all Windows-based applications.
